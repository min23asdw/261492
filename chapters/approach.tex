% \subsection{The Black Kitten}
  % One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to
% do with it:---it was the black kitten's fault entirely



% ~\cite{aiw}. 




%  For the
% white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for
% the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well,
% considering); so you see that it COULDN'T have had any hand in
% the mischief.

%   The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this:  first she
% held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with
% the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way,
% beginning at the nose:  and just now, as I said, she was hard at
% work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying
% to purr---no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.

%   But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the
% afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner
% of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep,
% the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of
% worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it
% up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was,
% spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the
% kitten running after its own tail in the middle.
